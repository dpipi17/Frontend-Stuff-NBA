        "Zion Williamson (8.1 per game) and Giannis Antetokounmpo (7.2 per game) rank 1-2 in field goals made inside five feet so far this season. Giannis is shooting 75.2% (115-153) at the basket, which ranks second among the 22 players with at least 100 attempts inside five feet. Williamson is shooting 61.0% (122-200), which ranks 13th in that group.",
        "With each team having a dominant force scoring at the basket, rim protection will be paramount in this matchup. The Bucks rank second in rim protection, allowing opponents to shoot 58.5% at the basket. The Pelicans rank 30th, allowing 68.8% shooting at the basket.",
        "The Bucks (22.6) and Pelicans (16.5) have both excelled in the first quarter of play, ranking first and second, respectively, in net rating in the gameâ€™s first 12 minutes. The second quarter has been a different story for the Pelicans as their net rating drops to minus-19.8 (30th), while the Bucks remain in the top five at 8.7.",
        "Giannis Antetokounmpo is drawing a career-best 10.1 free throw attempts per game (3rd in NBA), but is shooing a career-low 58.4% from the free throw line so far this season.",
        "Brandon Ingram enters Friday coming off back-to-back 30-point games; if he reaches 30 tonight it would be the first time in his career with three straight 30-point games. He is shooting 59.0% from the field, 47.4% from three and 100% from the free throw line over the past two games"
