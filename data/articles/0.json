        "In the last 21 years (from the 1999-00 season through last season), the Eastern Conference has had a winning record in interconference games only once. That was in the 2008-09 season when the East went 231-219 (.513) against the West. In each of the last 21 seasons, the West has been better.",
        "And we’re almost certainly going to make it 21 of 22. Only 96 (21%) of the 450 interconference games have been played thus far. But the West has already built a big advantage, going 59-37 (.615) through the first six weeks of the season. That would be the West’s fourth-best mark of the last 22 years, and its best since the 2013-14 season (.631).",
        "Through January, only six East teams are at or above .500. In the West, there are 10 teams no worse than 9-9. And the discrepancy could get bigger. With the shortened season, the league removed in-conference games, rather than interconference games. In a normal season, interconference games account for 37% of all games played. This season, they account for 42%.",
        "So get ready for a lot more. Over the last five weeks of the first-half schedule (between now and March 5), 17 of the league’s 30 teams are scheduled to play more games against the opposite conference than they are against their own. And this week’s schedule features a tasty, TNT double-header on Tuesday: Clippers-Nets and Celtics-Warriors. The Celtics will also visit the Clippers on Friday and the Suns on Sunday.",
        "Speaking of the Clippers, they’re the first team to unseat the Lakers at the top of the Power Rankings."
