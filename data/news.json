Thompson suffered the injury yesterday in aworkout in Southern California. He is expected to miss the 2020 - 21 season. \nIt 's the latest setback for the Warriors star, who missed the 2019-20 season with a torn ACL in his left knee.That partly contributed to the Warriors ' 15-50 record in 2019-20, resulting in Golden State selecting James Wiseman No.2 overall in the 2020 NBA Draft."

        "text": "The 2020 NBA draft was held on November 18, 2020. The draft was originally scheduled to be held at Barclays Center in Brooklyn on June 25, but was instead conducted at ESPN's facilities in Bristol, Connecticut, with the event held via videoconferencing. National Basketball Association(NBA) teams took turns selecting amateur United States college basketball players and other eligible players, including international players. It was televised nationally on ESPN. The draft lottery was originally scheduled to take place on May 19, 2020, but due to the ongoing COVID - 19 pandemic, it was instead held on August 20, 2020. This draft was the first since 1975 to be held not in June and was also the second to be done later than that month after the inaugural 1947 draft, which was conducted in July by the NBA 's predecessor, the Basketball Association of America(BAA)."
